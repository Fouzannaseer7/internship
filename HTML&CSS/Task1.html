    <h1>HTML AND CSS</h1>
    <p>This is a full paragraph. HTML will automatically handle the text inside the tag as a block-level element, which means it will start on a new line and take up the full width available. You can write as much text as you want here, and it will flow naturally within the paragraph, wrapping to the next line when it reaches the edge of its container. This is how you display a full paragraph in HTML.</p>
