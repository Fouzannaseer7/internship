    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>
        This is a full paragraph with proper spacing. HTML and CSS are used to style the text for better readability. 
        The paragraph has margin and padding to create space around it. The line height is increased to 1.6 for better 
        readability, and the text is justified for a clean look. You can add as much text as you want here, and it will 
        wrap naturally within the container. This example ensures that the paragraph looks neat and well-structured.
